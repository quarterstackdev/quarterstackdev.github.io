Hello There!!

Quarter Stack Dev LLC is a company formed by me, Haisum Mussawir, after I moved from the USA to Pakistan to be closer with my family. The people who worked with me in the US wanted to continue working with me so Quarter Stack Dev was formed to continue working as a contractor for them.

I have a lot of experience in several programming languages and DevOps tools. I also have a small team here in Pakistan that can do mobile app development. Since I am in Pakistan, I can deliver great work at much more affordable rates than North American companies.

If you have a project you would like to discuss with me, you can reach out at <a href="mailto:haisum@quarterstackdev.com">haisum@quarterstackdev.com</a>.

Have a Great Rest of Your Day :)
